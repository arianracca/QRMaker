# QR Maker

## Create your QR code with all your choices

The program will set automatically the "<https://www>." so you don't have to.
This is more comfortable to use.

1. Enter the url you want to make QR code (i.e.: mysite.com).
2. Enter the name of the image file you will save (i.e.: MySiteQRcode).
3. Enter the path you want to save your image file (i.e.: C:\MySiteFolder).
4. Select the format you want to save your image file: SVG (1) or PNG (2).
If you select any other choice the default option will be PNG.
